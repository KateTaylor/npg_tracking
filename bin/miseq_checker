=head1 NAME

miseq_checker - Monitor MiSeq instruments for run information.

=head1 VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    C<perl miseq_checker --ident (int|string)>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script takes the database id of a MiSeq as a required argument and tries
to update information in the database concerning the instrument itself and
concerning its current run.

The script tries first to connect via FTP to its controlling computer. If that
fails it look in the local staging area.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The script is intended to be called out from a crontab job, so take care when
editing it with full paths to executables and with environmental variables.

It should also work as a stand-alone.

It uses the $dev environmental variable to decide which database to use, using
the value to find a matching section in the config.ini file.
